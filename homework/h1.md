# CPSC 323 Homework #1 Directory "Tree" Search

Write a utility
```bash
./fiend [-P | -L]* FILENAME* EXPRESSION
```

that does depth-first traversals of the directory tree(s) rooted at the FILENAME (s) specified in the left-to-right order that they appear in the command line. For each file in each tree, it evaluates the EXPRESSION specified from left to right, according to the rules of precedence, until the outcome is known (the left-hand side of an AND operation is false or the left-hand side of an OR operation is true).

fiend (pronounced fie-end) is a stripped down version of the Linux utility find
that implements only the subset of command-line arguments containing:
- the "real" options -P and -L;
- the EXPRESSION components -depth, -exec, -maxdepth, -name, -newer, -print;
- the operators -o and -a.
 
Except as noted below, fiend matches the behavior of /bin/find (see man find
or Matthew and Stones, pp. 61-65) for the subset of arguments above.  Thus
- If present, the options -P (never follow symbolic links) and -L (always
  follow symbolic links) must appear before the first FILENAME.  The default
  is -P.  If more than one of -P and -L is specified, then the rightmost takes
  effect.
- The list of FILENAMEs begins with the first argument that is neither -P nor -L and ends just before the next argument that begins with a -. If no FILENAMEs are specified, the search is rooted at the current working directory (i.e., .).
- The EXPRESSION begins after the last filename (if any) and consists of
    - options (-depth and -maxdepth), which affect the overall traversal (rather than the evaluation of EXPRESSION) and always return true:
        - -depth specifies postorder traversal rather than the default preorder
        - -maxdepth N limits the traversal to depth N (N is a sequence of digits); if more than one -maxdepth is specified, then the rightmost takes effect
    - tests (-name and -newer), which return true or false:
        - -name RE specifies whether or not the local name matches the regex RE
        - -newer NAME specifies whether or not the file is newer than file NAME
    - actions (-print and -exec), which may have side effects and return true or false (-print always returns true):
        - -print prints the name of the file relative to the root of the tree
        - -exec ... executes a shell command with the arguments specified and returns true iff the status of the command reported by system() is 0
    - operators (-o and -a):
        - -o is OR
        - -a is AND
